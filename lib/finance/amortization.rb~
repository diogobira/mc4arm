  # the Amortization class provides an interface for working with loan amortizations.
  # @note There are _two_ ways to create an amortization.  The first
  #   example uses the amortize method for the Numeric class.  The second
  #   calls Amortization.new directly.
  # @example Borrow $250,000 under a 30 year, fixed-rate loan with a 4.25% APR
  #   rate = Rate.new(0.0425, :apr, :duration => 30.years)
  #   amortization = 250000.amortize(rate)
  # @example Borrow $250,000 under a 30 year, adjustable rate loan, with an APR starting at 4.25%, and increasing by 1% every five years
  #   values = %w{ 0.0425 0.0525 0.0625 0.0725 0.0825 0.0925 }
  #   rates = values.collect { |value| Rate.new( value, :apr, :duration = 5.years ) }
  #   arm = Amortization.new(250000, *rates)
  # @example Borrow $250,000 under a 30 year, fixed-rate loan with a 4.25% APR, but pay $150 extra each month
  #   rate = Rate.new(0.0425, :apr, :duration => 30.years)
  #   extra_payments = 250000.amortize(rate){ |period| period.payment - 150 }
